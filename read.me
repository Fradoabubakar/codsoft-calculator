In this implementation, the HTML file sets up the structure of the calculator and includes the CSS styles
 for the design. The JavaScript file contains the logic to handle user input and perform calculations.

The calculator has a display area to show user input and results, along with buttons for numbers,
 operators, and the equal sign. When users click on the buttons, the respective functions in the JavaScript
  file are called to handle the input and update the display accordingly.
